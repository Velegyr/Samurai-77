# Samurai-77
Fansite for video game Cyberpunk 2077. Final project for Glendale Community College Web Development class.

This is my first major project, a mostly hacked together fansite for the upcoming video game, Cyberpunk 2077.
As of current upload (11/17/2019) I have yet to get the media queries to function as intended. This is also
my first Github repository, as such I have no experience with Github or how it functions, either.
